# About Me!

Nick Feller, currently Software Engineer at Ericsson in Montreal Canada and Artificial Intelligence RA at Concordia University's Computational Intelligence Lab. I am primarily interested in building intuitive technologies that can serve anybody on the tech literacy spectrum. My lab/research focuses on plug and play - self adaptive engines for classification and retrieval; and my position at Ericsson focuses on product development.

## Biography

Grew up on the south shore of Montreal in a little town called Mont-Saint-Hilaire. Swiss, Canadian, Taiwanese citizen, born to a Swiss father and a Chinese/Japanese Mother. I spent a big part of the last 3 years working with the TEDx chapter in Montreal and at Concordia, both as a curator and head organizer. I've also work with the Red-Cross division of the Swiss Armed Forces to train troop helping with civil war aid missions in Eastern Europe. Aside from coding, I spend most of my free time between camping, biking, reading philosophy, playing guitar and putting weird decorations in my room.
