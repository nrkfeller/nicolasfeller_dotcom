# Welcome to my Website!

My name is Nick, I am studying at Concordia University in Computer Engineering. I also work at Ericsson as a SWE part time and do research at Concordia University's Computational Intelligence Lab under Dr Nawwaf Kharma. I'm a pretty big geek, I spend a lot of my free time learning and reading about computer science, math and philosophy.

I grew up in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec. Both my parents immigrated from Brazil and Switzerland because of maple syrup or something. My dad was born in Switzerland, he spoke 7 languages and travelled around the world many times over. My mom was born in Taiwan and grew up in Brazil, she also speaks like 5 languages.

I'm an insatiably curious person, I am an emeritus member of the used book store, wikipedia and quora (not really). I am also living proof that there is no physical limit to storing useless fact in your brain; sometimes I daydream about wining at Jeopardy.

Favorite podcasts Radiolab, Revisionist History, the Changelog. Favorite books : Walden, Leviathan, the Prince, L'Ã‰tranger, Nichomachean Ethics, to name a few.
