*September 2015 - Present*

I started working at Concordia University's [Computational Intellince Lab](http://explore.concordia.ca/expertise/artificial_intelligence) in September of 2015 under the supervision of [Dr Nawwaf Kharma](http://explore.concordia.ca/nawwaf-kharma) during my time here, I have worked on several projects. MY latest project has raised ~20'000$ in grants from NSERC discovery.

As part of the lab I also gave courses in Python (basics, data analysis and visualization) to graduate students in biology and chemistry.

Projects I have worked on:

1. Numerical optimization using combination of tabu search, simulated annealing and differential evolution (2015).
2. Pattern recognition game for Rock-Paper-Scissors (2016).
3. Sparse Distributed Memory algorithm (2016-2017).
